# Project Overview

This project was all about building a website to promote a festival promoting Brazilian-American community building. Theoretically partnering with BrasArte, a local San Francisco-based arts and community center for Brazilian culture, the festival was designed to celebrate the unique experience of being Brazilian-American, and the cultural wealth that it brings to induviduals in the diaspora. Celebrating years of cultural mixing between the US and Brazil, the festival features Bossa Nova music (a notable mix between American Jazz and Brazilian Samba), Samba dancing, Brazilian pastries and dishes, etc. The festival branding was designed in conjunction with the website, and the wbsite was built to best promote the festival. 

Having designed the wireframes in Figma, this was the first time I had ever translated a website from wireframe to code. Beginning with branding a festival, to created a desired look, to coding the function of the site, was all a new experience for me, and I learned quite a bit on the process of ideating on a website from start to finish. The website is meant to promote the festival, which is meant to promote the community. Had I more time, I would consider ideating on creating a forum for discussion among attendees and potential festival-goers to better provide a space for people to interact with their community.
